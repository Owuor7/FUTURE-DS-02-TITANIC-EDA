# FUTURE-DS-02-TITANIC-EDA

Titanic Survival Analysis Project
Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival. The analysis examines key features such as passenger age, gender, and survival status, revealing how these factors influenced survival rates in the Titanic disaster.

Project Motivation
The primary goal of this project is to:

Explore the Titanic dataset to uncover trends in passenger demographics and survival rates.
Use visualizations to convey insights that help explain the factors contributing to the likelihood of survival.
Provide an in-depth understanding of how age, gender, and other features are related to survival outcomes on the Titanic.

Key Findings
Here are some key insights from the analysis:

Age Distribution: The majority of passengers were between 20-40 years old, with fewer older passengers. There was also a notable number of young children aboard.
Gender and Survival: A significantly higher percentage of women survived compared to men. This aligns with historical accounts of evacuation prioritizing women and children.
Survival Patterns: The analysis suggests that gender, age, and ticket class (Pclass) were strong indicators of survival. Further exploration of these variables provides deeper insights into the tragedy.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language used.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive code development and documentation.
